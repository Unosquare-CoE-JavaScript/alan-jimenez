## Cooperative multitasking
Programs decide when could be an appropriate time to let another program  run by yielding execution to the operating system.
> If a program fails, no more programs continue executing

## Preemptive multitasking
OS determines which program would run on the CPU, this approach allows the OS to switch programs execution using its own notion of scheduling.
Most of the modern operating systems use this approach.

Many classic server programs (eg. Apache) use the main thread to interact with the user, while every operation is done on a separate worker thread.
