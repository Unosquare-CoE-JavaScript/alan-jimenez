# Entity Framework
> Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper that enables .NET developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.

## "Code First" approach
This approach is when database doesn't exist and we create the definitions using classes, we can also modify the model to update the database using the Code First Migration feature.

## "Database First" approach

## "Model First" approach
The database is defined using Entity Data Model Wizard in Visual Studio.
